# Object-oriented programming (OOP) for Economics Students
This repository encompasses introductory Python and OOP concepts, along with an exploration of their application in economics.

I have gathered my notes from several sources. Primarily, I have drawn from the "Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis" course at the University of Copenhagen. In addition, I have used material from the QuantEcon lecture series. 

To get a basic understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) I recommend a lecture delivered by MIT (OCW), which is available at the following link: https://youtu.be/-DP1i2ZU9gk.
