# Object-oriented programming (OOP) for Economics Students
This document encompasses introductory Python and OOP concepts, along with an exploration of their application in economics.

I have gathered my notes from several sources, including the "Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis" course at the University of Copenhagen, the materials available on QuantEcon, and a lecture on OOP by MIT (OCW), which can be accessed at the following link: https://youtu.be/-DP1i2ZU9gk.
